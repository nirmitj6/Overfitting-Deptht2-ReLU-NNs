# Overfitting-Deptht2-ReLU-NNs
This project contains codes for the paper: "Noisy Interpolation Learning with Shallow Univariante ReLU Networks" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15396)

Run the jupyter notebook. The codes are adapted from (https://github.com/eboursier/penalising_biases), who derived the min-norm characterization in the univariate setting.
